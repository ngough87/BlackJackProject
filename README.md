# BlackJack Project


## Description

The objective of the BlackJack project is to allow me to 
gain more experience with object oriented programming. 
This project requires the use of multiple packages, classes, 
methods, enumerated types etc. This project is especially challenging because it requires more attention to calling methods ensuring that everything is communicating with one another. 

The end result is an Black Jack application, through which a player can play a few rounds of no frills Black Jack. 


## Technologies Used

- Java
- Eclipse
- Git
- GitHub



## Lessons Learned
- The biggest lesson learned I learned during this project was understanding the relationship between the entities. Making sure that you are calling the right methods and that they are doing the right thing is challenging. 

- The next biggest lesson was simplifying my code. At first my code looked very redundant. It wasn't until reviewing (several times), did I realize that had to change! 

- A HUGE and critical lesson is realizing the importance of Skill Distillery TAs! Without whom, I would have been lost!!
