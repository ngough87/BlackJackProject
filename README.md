#BlackJack Project


##Description

The objective of the BlackJack project is to allow me to 
gain more experience with object oriented programming. 
This project requires the use of multiple packages, classes, 
methods, enumerated types etc. This project is especially challenging because it requires more attention to calling methods ensuring that everything is communicating with one another.
